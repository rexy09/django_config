# Installing the Packages from the Ubuntu Repositories

To begin the process, we’ll download and install all of the items we need from the Ubuntu repositories. We will use the Python package manager pip to install additional components a bit later.

We need to update the local apt package index and then download and install the packages. The packages we install depend on which version of Python your project will use.

If you are using Django with Python 3, type:

```
sudo apt update
```
```
sudo apt install python3-pip python3-dev libpq-dev
```
```
sudo apt install nginx curl
```
```
sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib
```
